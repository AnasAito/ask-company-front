            I usually choose Articles published by big tech companies to learn
            how they use technologies (that Im familiar with or that I want to
            learn about)to solve small or large real problems in real life.This
            keep me motivated (Why do i need to lean this tech?) and also gives
            me ideas about real life use cases

            This articles are scattered all over the web and you need time to
            find relevant ones . The goal of Tech signal is to gather and make
            them searchable. That it!
